        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 rashers streaky bacon</li>
            <li>20 g chipotle paste</li>
            <li>6 plain taco tortillas</li>
            <li>225 g pork and oregano sausage meat</li>
            <li>60 g mature cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pot smashed avocado</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <!--Step One-->
            <li>
                <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas mark 7.</p>
                <p>Lay the bacon in a single layer on a lined baking tray.</p>
                <p>Once the oven is hot, bake on the middle shelf of your oven until golden brown and crispy, 10-15 mins. IMPORTANT: Wash your hands and equipment after handling raw meat. Cook bacon thoroughly.</p>
            </li>
            <!--Step Two-->
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat.</p>
                <p>Once hot, add the pork sausage meat and fry until browned, 5-6 mins. Use a spoon to break it up as it cooks. IMPORTANT: Wash your hands and equipment after handling raw meat. It's cooked when no longer pink in the middle.</p>
                <p>Once the sausage meat is cooked, add the chipotle paste and cook for a further 1 min, then transfer to a small bowl and cover to keep warm. TIP: Keep the fat in the pan to fry your eggs.</p>
            </li>
            <!--Step Three-->
            <li>
                <p>Whilst the sausage cooks, grate the cheese.</p>
                <p>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until combined and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</p>
            </li>
            <!--Step Four-->
            <li>
                <p>Return the (now empty) frying pan back to medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. </p>
                <p>Once hot, pour in the whisked eggs and cook for 30 secs without stirring, then gently stir, making sure the eggs don't stick to the bottom of the pan, 2-3 mins. Once cooked, remove from the heat. IMPORTANT: Ensure egg whites are fully cooked.</p>
            </li>
            <!--Step Five-->
            <li>
                <p>When the eggs have 2 mins remaining in the pan, pop the tortillas onto a baking tray and into the oven on the top shelf to warm through, 1-2 mins.</p>
            </li>
            <!--Step Six-->
            <li>
                <p>To build your breakfast tortillas, lay them flat on a board, then place a bacon rasher in the middle of each.</p>
                <p>Arrange the scrambled eggs, chipotle sausage meat and a dollop of smashed avocado on top. </p>
                <p>Carefully transfer the tortillas to 2 serving plates and sprinkle over the grated cheese to finish.</p>
                <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
