            <li>100 ml water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas mark 7.</p>
                <p>Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil with 1/2 tsp salt for the tagliatelle.</p>
                <p>Lay the bacon in a single layer onto a baking tray and bake on the middle shelf of your oven until golden brown and crispy, 10-15 mins. IMPORTANT: Wash your hands and equipment after handling raw meat. Cook bacon thoroughly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan on medium-high heat.</p>
                <p>Once hot, add the pork mince and mushrooms. Cook until browned, 5-6 mins. Use a spoon to break up the mince as it cooks, then drain and discard any excess fat.</p>
                <p>Season with salt and pepper. IMPORTANT: Wash your hands and equipment after handling raw mince. It's cooked when no longer pink in the middle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When your pan of water is boiling, add the tagliatelle and bring back to the boil. Cook until tender, 3-4 mins.</p>
                <p>Once cooked, drain in a colander and pop back in the pan. Drizzle with oil and stir through to stop it sticking together.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>While everything cooks, pour the Worcester sauce into the pork and allow to evaporate, 1 min.</p>
                <p>Stir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine jus paste, sugar and water for the sauce (see pantry for both amounts).</p>
                <p>Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium and simmer until slightly thickened, 6-8 mins.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, peel and grate the garlic (or use a garlic press). </p>
                <p>Halve the ciabatta and lay onto a baking tray, cut-side up.</p>
                <p>Spread over the garlic and drizzle with the olive oil for the garlic bread (see pantry for amount).</p>
                <p>Bake the garlic ciabatta on the top shelf of your oven until golden, 5-6 mins.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When everything's ready, add the cooked pasta to the sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper if needed.</p>
                <p>Share your ultimate pork ragu between your bowls. Crumble over the bacon, then top with the Parmigiano Reggiano.</p>
                <p>Mix the pesto with a little olive oil in a small bowl to thin it, then spoon over the pasta.</p>
                <p>Serve the garlia ciabatta alongside cut diagonally into triangles. </p>
                <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
