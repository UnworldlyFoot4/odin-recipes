        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This take on the classic Billionaire's Dessert layers rich coconut chocolate with salted caramel sauce, speculoos biscuit crumb and hazelnuts. Leave to chill or enjoy straight away - it'll be just as delicious either way!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>125 g biscuit crumb</li>
            <li>200 ml coconut milk</li>
            <li>40 g hazelnuts</li>
            <li>80 g salted caramel sauce</li>
            <li>100 g chocolate chips</li>
            <li>30 g butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <!--Step One-->
            <li>
                <p>Melt the butter (see pantry for amount) in a saucepan on medium-low heat. When melted, remove from the heat.</p>
                <p>Reserve 3 tsp of the speculoos biscuit crumb in a small bowl and set aside. Add the remaining speculoos biscuit crumbs to the melted butter and mix together until combined.</p>
                <p>Divide between 2 appropriately sized glasses or ramekins and lightly pat the crumbs down with the back of a spoon to make the base.</p>
                <p>Divide the salted caramel sauce over the top of the biscuit base and pop into the fridge to firm up while you make the filling.</p>
            </li>
            <!--Step Two-->
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, pour the coconut milk into a medium pan and pop onto medium-high heat.</p>
                <p>Bring to the boil and simmer for 1 min. Remove from the heat and immediately add the chocolate chips and a pinch of salt.</p>
                <p>Allow to sit for 1 min, then stir the coconut milk and chocolate together until the chocolate is melted and everything is completely combined. Allow to cool, 5 mins.</p>
                <p>Whilst the mixture cools, roughly crush the hazelnuts in the unopened sachet using a rolling pin.</p>
            </li>
            <!--Step Three-->
            <li>
                <p>Pour the coconut chocolate mixture into the glasses or ramekins.</p>
                <p>Cover with cling film and pop into the fridge to set - this will take 2-3 hours if you want them fully set, but they'll still be delicious if you want to eat them immediately or in an hour.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle each chocolate pot with the reserved speculoos biscuit crumb and the hazelnuts to finish.</p>
                <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
